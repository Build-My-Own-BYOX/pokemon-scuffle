# pokemon-scuffle
A self-implementation for Pokemon Playground App

My aims for this repo is learning how to:
1. Code react native for mobile
2. Apply clean architecture & code
3. Apply testing for mobile development
Overall, I will have a production mindset in developping mobile application with react native.

Features will be included: 
1. Pokemon atlas (must have) 
2. Sign up/sign in pokemon trainers (should have)
3. Battleup (nice to have)
